                    In terms of <b>time complexity</b>, quick sort is performing well and our group selected it as the most efficient sorting method as it can finish sorting unlisted arrays the fastest. Also, it is holding O(n log(n)) for both average and best case, making it show the best performance among others. Bubble sort also has its advantages. However, bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort do not exhibit efficient performance and take longer to complete the sorting compared to quick sort. As a result, the lower the time complexity of the sorting, the better as it takes fewer operations and less time to sort different data.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    For <b>space complexity</b>, bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are the most space-efficient. They shared a common space complexity of O(1) which means these three sorts only need a consistent amount of additional space, no matter how big the input is. They do not require additional memory. Quick sort has a space complexity of O(log (n)) and it is less space-efficient. Quick sort uses a moderate amount of additional memory as the recursion stack is involved in the sorting action. Bucket sort is the least space-efficient among the five methods because additional memory is required. When more data is input to the unsorted list, more memory and space usage will be required. Through the comparison of space complexity, we gained more understanding and insights into requirements towards additional memory. If space efficiency is aimed when there is a large data set in the list, then bucket sorting would not be a smart choice.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Lastly, we explored the impact of <b>input data characteristics</b> on complexity. The characteristics of the input data do affect bucket sort. For instance, when the elements are unevenly and randomly distributed in the list, it would affect the complexity of bucket Sort and did not suit our expectations in the beginning. On the other hand, we observed that bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort are not as easily influenced by the characteristics of the input data compared to bucket sort.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    By comparing different sorting methods’ <b>time complexity, space complexity, and impact of input data characteristics on complexity</b>, we know more about each of their characteristics. If sorting is required, we will be able to identify which one suits us the most. As a result, it would be a more time-saving and efficient sorting process.
