                    <b>Siyi’s reflection:</b> I think the process of learning and exploring different sorting methods is an interesting experience. Different methods have similar and different characteristics. Learning how to identify their characteristics and matching them to our own needs can help reduce the time used in picking up a wrong sorting action. Thus, this experience helped increase my critical thinking skills and gave me a concept of how to make quicker decisions based on time complexity.

                    <b>Yufei’s reflection:</b> Before this project, I have learnt something about sorting methods and other algorithms written in C++ out of interest. However, I used to know nothing about HTML or JavaScript. During the cooperation with my teammates, I explore sorting methods more systematically from different aspects which has been shown in our report. I felt such a sense of accomplishment when running our website successfully for the first time. Also, delving into our project more deeply, I realize the importance of owning the motivation towards out-of-class learning and communication with others.

                    <b>Shichao’s reflection:</b>In this project, I was primarily responsible for the design, construction, and functionality implementation of the website interface. My biggest takeaway was learning how to utilize online resources to achieve the effects I wanted. Before this, my understanding of websites was limited to classroom exercises and tutorials. However, in the project, after designing the website, I realized I didn't know any code for "navigation bars". So, I first learned how to use &lt;div>, &lt;ul>, &lt;li>, and then how to use JavaScript to hide/show the navigation bar, eventually achieving my initial design. This project taught me how to self-learn, which is an important skill for future work.

                    <b>Pui Yan’s reflection:</b> Before doing this project, I didn’t learn about sorting. After researching it, I found that it is helpful in our daily lives. When we were young, we needed to order different numbers in ascending or descending order in different assignments; now, we use different coding, such as Javascript, to order the data. In this project, we had many Zoom meetings to discuss the project, such as video taking, script, and website design. Our group agreed that using the interactive method shows different sorting methods to attract the audience. Also, the most challenging part was coding and editing the video. I used almost 6-7 hours to edit the first version of the video.However, the words of the script covered the words in PowerPoint. After Anny taught me to use CapCut, the video became better. I use the lecture notes and references online to write the code for the coding. This experience enhanced my deeper knowledge about writing JavaScript and my interest in video editing.
